## Introduction
This is a version of the classic Space Invaders game released in 1978. The player controls a spaceship and fires projectiles at the enemy space invaders. A point is awarded if an enemy space invader is destroyed. The player starts out with 3 lives and loses 1 life for each enemy space invader that managed to escape being destroyed. It will be an immediate game over if the player collides into an enemy space invader. 

## Learning Outcomes
- OOP concepts such as inheritance and abstraction. The game is broken down into smaller bits such as the spaceship that the player controls, the descending enemy space invaders, the bullet the spaceship fires, and even the scoreboard.
- Using python turtle graphics to make a fairly complex game.
- Understanding game logic.
- General Python 3 programming proficiency.

## Future Work
Possible addition of sound effects and music to enhance game experience. The speed at which the enemies descend should get increasingly faster as the game progresses to increase the difficulty and make it more challenging for the player.
